<p>The LifeAggregator product demonstrates how a quote aggregator
	can be built using OpenUnderwriter.</p>
<p>This product defines a basic set of questions for Term Life
	insurance. The common set of questions are used to prepare three quotes
	from three different insurance organisations: Met, Star, and Reliance.
	Once the system has prepare the quotations they are presented to the
	user in a table. From here the user can compare the offerings and
	select one of them to take up.</p>
<p>When the user selects one of the quotations they are taken from
	the aggregator product's page flow into the page flow for the selected
	product. From here on the selected product's page flow takes over the
	quotation process through to payment.</p>
