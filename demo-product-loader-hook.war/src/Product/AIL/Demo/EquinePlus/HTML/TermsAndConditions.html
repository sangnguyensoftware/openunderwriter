<p class="term-title"><b>Policy Cancellation</b><br />
</p>
<p class="term-body">You have the right to cancel your policy during
 a period of 14 days after the day of purchase of the contract or the day
 on which you receive your policy documentation, whichever is later. If
 you wish to do so and the insurance cover has not yet started, you will
 be entitled to a full refund of the premium paid.</p>
<p class="term-body">Alternatively, if you wish to do so and if the
 insurance cover has already started, you will be entitled to a refund of
 the premium paid, subject to a deduction for the time for which you have
 been covered calculated as a proportion of the time for which the
 insurance would have provided cover and an administration fee of &#163;39.00
 (including Insurance Premium Tax at the appropriate rate) to cover any
 costs incurred by us in issuing the policy. To exercise your right to
 cancel your policy, please call ${broker/quoteTelephoneNumber}. Please
 also return your certificate of motor insurance. If you do not exercise
 your right to cancel your policy, it will continue in force for the term
 of the policy and you will be required to pay the premium as stated.</p>
