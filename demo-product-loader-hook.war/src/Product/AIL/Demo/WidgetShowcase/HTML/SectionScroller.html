<p>
	A Section scroller displays repeating blocks of questions. The data for
	the questions is selected from the model by the scroller's
	<code>binding</code>
	property.

<p>
	The screenshot above shows a SectionScroller which is bound to assets -
	in this case vehicle assets. The binding has selected two of these
	assets (as Records) from the
	<code>Policy</code>
	being processed, and for each of those assets it renders a section
	built up from the page elements contained in the SectionScroller. In
	this example, the SectionScroller contains 8 page elements, two of
	which have detail associated with them.
</p>
<p>
	A SectionScroller also has an optional
	<code>repeatedTitle</code>
	property which is rendered at the top of each section. The text of this
	attribute may be static, or as in this case dynamic. Dynamic titles are
	rendered using the context of the selected record, and may therefore be
	bound to fields in the record. In this case, the title is bound to the
	vehicle asset's make, model, and registrationNumber attributes.
</p>
<p>The remainder of this page gives examples of each attribute type
	bound into single row section scrollers. In each case an outline is
	given of how the pageflow and model can be configured including
	optional fields.
