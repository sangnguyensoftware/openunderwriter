<p>The AggregatorQuotationSelection widget allows a user to select
	one of the quotations offered by an aggregator to move forward with.</p>
<p>A quote aggregator product is on that is designed to ask the user
	one set of questions and to use that one set of common questions to
	prepare quotations for a number of products - generally from competing
	insurers.</p>
<p>Once the quotation have been prepared, they are displayed to the
	user using this widget. The user can then decide to move forward with
	one of quotations.</p>
<p>As the system is quoting for a number of products, the widget
	allows for some of those quotations to end in referrals or declines as
	well as resulting in a premium. All results are listed.</p>
