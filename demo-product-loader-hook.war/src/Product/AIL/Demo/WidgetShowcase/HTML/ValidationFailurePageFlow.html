<p>By default when a PageFlow encounters validation errors the
	details of the errors are persisted along with the object being worked
	on. If, for example, the user is working on a Policy object and an
	answer they have given does not pass validation then the Policy will be
	persisted along with the answer given and an error marker identifying
	the problem.</p>
<p>For public facing PageFlows this makes sense since it allows the
	user to return to the page days or weeks later and find it in the same
	state that they left it in. More importantly it means that support
	staff can view the policy and see exactly the errors the user has seen,
	making it easier for them to assist the user.</p>
<p>However, this behaviour is not ideal for all circumstances. In
	some PageFlows, especially those used by back office staff, the user
	would expect values to be persisted only when the whole page has passed
	validation. This can be achieved by setting rollbackOnValidationFailure
	to true.</p>
<p>This PageFlow is configured in that way.</p>
