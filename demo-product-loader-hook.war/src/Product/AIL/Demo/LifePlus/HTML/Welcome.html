<p>The LifePlus product demonstrates the basics of OpenUnderwriter
	product structure and functionality. As a life insurance product it is
	unrealistically simple, but it does serve as a good starting point for
	those interested in understanding more about OpenUnderwriter.</p>
<p>
	You can find the definition of the product, and all of the content
	related to it, in the product document library in the <font
		face="courier new,courier">/AIL/Demo/LifePlus</font> folder.
</p>
<p>The product has a single Asset (the life insured), a single
	section and rates on just four questions. However, it is complete in
	terms of features. For example, referrals and quotations are handled, a
	quotation document can be requested, broker email notifications are
	issued and payment information is collected.</p>
