<p>This is a reasonably complex widget that gives the user the
	ability to view and manage the documents associated with a Policy and
	to upload new documents. The widget also gives access to an Archive
	area where documents are stored when deleted.</p>

&lt;documentManager [renderHint="<i>inline</i>"] 
                 [validDocumentTypes="<i>regular expression</i>"] 
                 [validLabels="<i>regular expression</i>"]
                 [fileTypes="<i>file extension list</i>"]
                 [binding="<i>xpath</i>"]/&gt;
</pre>
<ul>
	<li><i>render hint</i> - By default when the user downloads a file
		from the document manager, it will be given the Content-Disposition of
		attachment. Most browsers will respond by downloading the content and
		storing it in the user's Downloads folder. However, If a value of "<i>inline</i>"
		is used, the Content-Disposition will be set to "inline". Typically,
		browsers will now open the document in a new browser tab if they have
		a viewer for the file's mime type.</li>
	<li><i>validDocumentTypes</i> - A regular expression constraining
		the document types which should be included in the manager.</li>
	<li><i>validLabels</i> - A regular expression to constrain the
		documents included in the manager based on the labels associated with
		the document.</li>
	<li><i>fileTypes</i> - A comma separated list of file extensions
		that should be accepted for uploaded. For example: "pdf,png,jpg".
		Defaults to "png"</li>
	<li><i>binding</i> - A xPath for the source of the Documents. 
		This is the path to a Type that implements HasDocuments.
		For example "/" will bind to the actual policy.
		If the binding is not set it will default to use the policy.</li>
</ul>
