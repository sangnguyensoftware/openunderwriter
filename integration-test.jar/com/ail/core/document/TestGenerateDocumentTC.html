<b>Policy Cancellation</b><br/>
You have the right to cancel your policy during a period of 14 
days after the day of purchase of the contract or the day on which 
you receive your policy documentation, whichever is later. 
If you wish to do so and the insurance cover has not yet started, 
you will be entitled to a full refund of the premium paid. 
Alternatively, if you wish to do so and if the insurance cover has 
already started, you will be entitled to a refund of the premium 
paid, subject to a deduction for the time for which you have been 
covered calculated as a proportion of the time for which the 
insurance would have provided cover and an administration fee of 
£30.45 (including Insurance Premium Tax at the appropriate rate) 
to cover any costs incurred by us in issuing the policy. To exercise 
your right to cancel your policy, please call ${broker/quoteTelephoneNumber}. 
Please also return your certificate of motor insurance. 
If you do not exercise your right to cancel your policy, it will 
continue in force for the term of the policy and you will be required 
to pay the premium as stated.<br/><br/>
<b>How to claim</b><br/>

<b>Disclosure of material information </b><br/>
Failure to disclose all material information or any change in the 
information advised (i.e. information likely to influence the 
assessment of this risk) could invalidate the insurance. If you are 
in any doubt whether any information is material it should be 
disclosed. It is an offence under the Road Traffic Act to make any 
false statements or withhold any information to obtain a Certificate 
of Motor Insurance. <br/>
Insurers pass information to the Claims and Underwriting 
Exchange Register, run by Insurance Database Services Ltd (IDS 
Ltd) and the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register, run 
by the Association of British Insurers (ABI). The aim is to help us 
to check information provided and also to prevent fraudulent 
claims. When we deal with your request for insurance, we may 
search these registers. Under the conditions of your policy, you 
must tell us about any incident (such as an accident or theft) which 
may or may not give rise to a claim. When you tell us about an 
incident, we will pass information relating to it to the registers. 
Your insurance cover details will be added to the Motor Insurance 
Database, run by the Motor Insurers' Information Centre (MIIC). 
This has been set up to help identify uninsured drivers, and may 
be searched by the Police to help confirm who is insured to drive. 
If there is an accident, the Database may be used by insurers, 
MIIC and the Motor Insurers' Bureau to identify relevant policy 
information. You can ask us for more information about this. You 
should show this notice to anyone insured to drive the vehicle 
covered under the policy. <br/>
