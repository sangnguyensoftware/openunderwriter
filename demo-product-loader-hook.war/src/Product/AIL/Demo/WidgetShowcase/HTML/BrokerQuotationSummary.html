<p>A page element to display a summary of a quotation or policy that contents 
information that is useful to a broker.</p>
<p>This widget can be used from PageFlows, but it also designed to be used to define
the body text of broker notification emails. The email generator is pre-configured to 
use this template to generate the body text. The template can of course be overriden 
within the product hierarchy to provide different templates for each product, or for
product suites. </p>
<p>More information on broker notifications and how to use them can be found on the

wiki page.
