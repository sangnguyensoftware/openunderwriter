<p>PageFlows are naturally designed to be as robust as possible but
	there is always the chance of an unforeseen problem. When one does
	occur we want to be sure that the user is shown a tidy error rather
	than an ugly stack trace.</p>
<p>This page is designed to allow the error handling screen to be
	tested. It does this by generating an unrecoverable error on demand
	whenever the button below is pressed.</p>
<table class="tip">
	<tr>
		<td>As the sandpit is specifically built for product developers,
			it handles errors very differently from the customer facing
			PageFlowPortlet. As a result of this, this test will only display the
			customer facing error when it is executed from outside the sandpit,
			i.e. when it is deployed using the PageFlow portlet.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
