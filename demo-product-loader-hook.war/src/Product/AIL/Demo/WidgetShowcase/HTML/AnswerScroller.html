<p>The AnswerScroller widget displays a repeating pattern of
	answers. For example, if a motor policy were allowed to contain a
	number of vehicle assets, and AnswerScroller could be used to output a
	table summarising the vehicle's registration numbers and engine sizes.
	An AnswerScroller may contain any number of Answer elements and is
	generally used on summary screens within an AnswerSection to output
	blocks of repeating answers.</p>
