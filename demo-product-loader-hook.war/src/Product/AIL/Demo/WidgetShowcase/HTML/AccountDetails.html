<p>Display summary information about an party's account and payment
	schedule.</p>
<p>The options listed below control what information is presented
	and in what format. Information is taken from the financial account and
	transaction data associated with a party on the policy and and a
	payment schedule held on the policy.</p>
<p>
	When an <i>accountBinding</i> is specified a summary of the account
	will be displayed including status, balance, opening date, currency
	etc. Additionally, if <i>showStatement</i> is set to <i>true</i> the a
	statement showing transactions on the account is also included. The <i>period</i>
	option controls how far back in history the statement should cover.
</p>
<p>
	If <i>showNormalizedSchedule</i> is set to <i>true</i> then the payment
	scheduled identified by <i>scheduleBinding</i> is displayed in its
	normalized form. In this form a payment that is set to repeat monthly
	is listed as one entry.
</p>
<p>
	The <i>showActualizedSchedule</i> options is similar, but repeating
	payments are shown "unrolled". So, if <i>period</i> is set to 3 Month,
	a repeating payment which is valid for the whole period would show as
	three separate payments. Also, in this mode, when multiple payments
	fall due on the same day they are rolled up into one row with a
	description explaining how they are made up.
