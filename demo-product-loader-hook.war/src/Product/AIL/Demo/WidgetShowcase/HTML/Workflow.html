<p>PageFlows provide a set of widgets which trigger the execution of
	workflows.</p>

<p>In this sample page workflows are attached to buttons to make
	testing easier. However, it is probably more common to invoke them
	conditionally on entry to, or exit from, a page.</p>

<u>PageFlow</u>
<p>Specific triggers are provided for common workflows (e.g. new
	business referral). In general these do not require any additional
	arguments:
<p>
<pre>
    &lt;commandButtonAction label="..." destinationPageId="..." &gt;
        &lt;triggerNewBusinessReferralWorkflow /&gt;
    &lt;/commandButtonAction&gt;
</pre>
<p>A general trigger is provided to allow other supported workflows
	to be triggered by name:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;commandButtonAction label="..." destinationPageId="..." &gt;
        &lt;triggerNamedWorkflow workflowCommandName="<i>command name</i>" /&gt;
    &lt;/commandButtonAction&gt;
</pre>
<ul>
	<li><i>workflowCommandName</i> The name of the trigger command
		(defined in the product's Registry.xml).</li>
</ul>

<u>More common usage</u>
<p>The examples above show how to trigger a workflow directly from a
	button on a page - i.e. the way that this page is setup. However, it is
	more common to trigger them as the result of an event. The new business
	referral workflow might, for example, be triggered automatically when
	the referral page is displayed:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;questionPage id="Referral" title="Referral"&gt;
        &lt;triggerNewBusinessReferralWorkflow when="onRenderResponse" /&gt;
        ...
    &lt;questionPage&gt;
</pre>
<p>A workflow can also be triggered conditionally:
<p>
<pre>
    &lt;questionPage id="..." title="..."&gt;
        &lt;triggerNewBusinessReferralWorkflow when="onRenderResponse" condition=""i:test(status[.='REFERRED'])"/&gt;
        ...
    &lt;questionPage&gt;
</pre>
<div class="pf-page-title">Using this test page</div>
<p>To help in the testing of workflows, you can override the policy
	number of the policy being used by this test by entering a string in
	the field below and clicking "Apply Override Values". This will make it
	easier to identify the workflows created when the "Trigger New Business
	Referral Workflow" is used to trigger the actual workflow.<p>
