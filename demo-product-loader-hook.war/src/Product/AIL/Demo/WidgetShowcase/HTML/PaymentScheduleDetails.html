<p>Setup a payment schedule against a policy.</p>
<p>This widget allows a user to setup a payment schedule against a
	policy. The PageFlow author can control which amount is to be paid,
	what methods may be used to pay it, at what frequencies payments may be
	made and the purpose for the schedule.</p>
<p>A policy will typically allow for one payment schedule to be
	current for each purpose. So, one schedule for premium collection, one
	for arrears clearance, and one for claims payments. If a schedule
	already exists within the policy for the purpose specified then it will
	be replaced when the user opts to save the new schedule.</p>
<p>The user has the option to vary the amount to be paid, the
	frequency of payments and number of payments (within limits defined by
	the PageFlow author). The widget can then calculate the actual payment
	amounts and dates and display them.</p>

<ul>
	<li><i>title</i> Title text for the page element.</li>
	<li><i>binding</i> An xpath reference to the party who will make the payments. Defaults to '/client'.</li>
	<li>The amount to be paid can be specified in one of three ways:<ol>
			<li><i>accountBinding</i> Fetch the balance from the account
				owned by the party referred to by this binding, and use its negative
				value. For example, for <code>accountBinding='/client'</code>, the
				current balance of the client's account would be fetched and
				negated. An overdrawn balance of -150.00 would result in an amount
				to be paid of 150.00</li>
			<li><i>amountBinding</i> Use the value of the CurrencyAmount
				referred to as the amount due. For example, <code>amountBinding='/totalPremium'</code>
				would result in the amount being set to the value of the policy's
				total premium property.</li>
			<li><i>amount</i> The amount is specified directly in the
				PageFlow. For example: <code>amount='150GBP'</code>.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li><i>frequencyOptions</i> A comma separated list of acceptable
		payment frequencies. E.G.: <code>frequencyOptions='MONTHLY,YEARLY'</code>.

	<li><i>minimumNumberOfPayments</i> Minimum number of payments
		allowed - defaults to 2.</li>
	<li><i>maximumNumberOfPayments</i> Maximum number of payments
		allowed - defaults to 12</li>
	<li><i>type</i> The name of a type to be used to create the
		MoneyProvision for this schedule if the policy does not already
		contain one for the <code>purpose</code>.</li>
	<li><i>purpose</i> The purpose of the schedule. Must be one of:
		PREMIUM, CLAIM, ARREARS</li>
	<li><i>allowablePaymentMethods</i> Defines a comma separated list
		of the methods of payment that are valid. For example: <code>allowablePaymentMethods='DirectDebit,PaymentCard,PayPal'</code>.
		Valid options are: DirectDebit, PaymentCard, PayPal, Eway, SagePay,
		Orange, Stripe, IWinPay. The list of payment methods presented is a
		result of filtering the payment methods associated with the party
		against the list defined by <i>allowablePaymentMethods</i></li>
	<li><i>renderHint</i> Render hint to be output.</li>
