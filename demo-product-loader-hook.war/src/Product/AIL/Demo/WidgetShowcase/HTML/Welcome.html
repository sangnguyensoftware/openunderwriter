<p>This is a special product in that unlike the other demonstration
products it doesn&#39;t process policies. Instead, it&#39;s purpose is
two fold:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>To provide a resource to product developers detailing the
		widgets that are available for use from within PageFlows and to
		demonstrate how those widgets can setup and used. You&#39;ll find the
		complete product in the AIL/Demo/WidgetShowcase space in the product
		manager.</p></li>
	<li><p>To support the testing of new widgets and the regression
		testing of existing widgets. In the Test Suite within the
		WidgetShowcase space there are a collection of <a
		href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> test scripts which can
		be run at any time to test the correct operation of the widgets.
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A widget within OpenUnderwriter is a piece of high level UI
	functionality. Rather than building UIs using buttons, labels, text
	boxes and radio buttons (etc.) PageFlows widgets supply higher level
	components which are appropriate to insurance. For example, there is a
	single widget which collects policy holder details (name, address,
	etc); there is a single widget that displays rating information, along
	with widgets that simplify the task of asking a question and validating
	the answers.</p>
<p>
	This product is intended to be viewed from within OpenUnderwriter&#39;s
	Sandpit portlet. This portlet is only visible to users in the
	&quot;product developers&quot; group (e.g. the default user
	&quot;davy&quot;). The Sandpit&#39;s Page dropdown is used to move
	between the widgets.<br />
