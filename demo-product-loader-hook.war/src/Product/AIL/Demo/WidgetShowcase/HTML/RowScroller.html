<p>
	A RowScroller represents a Collection of records in a table format with
	one row per record. 
</p>

<p>
	The records included in the scroller are selected by the scroller's <i>binding</i>,
	and the columns are defined by the <i>AttributeFields</i> included in
	the scroller's <i>items</i> list.
</p>
<p>
	The form elements used to render each item cell and the validations
	applied to them are both defined by the nature of the <i>Attribute</i>
	that the item is bound to. The binding itself is evaluated relative to
	the binding of the scroller. See <i>SectionScroller</i> for an example.
</p>
<p>
	RowScroller supports the addition and removal of rows from the scroller
	if the <i>addAndDeleteEnabled</i> property is set to true. If this is
	the case, then the <b>row controls</b> (see screenshot) are rendered.
	The <i>minRows</i> and <i>maxRows</i> properties limit what the user
	can do. A user cannot remove rows if that would leave the scroller with
	less than <i>minRows</i>, and the <b>add row</b> icon will be disabled
	if the scroller already contains <i>maxRows</i>. In the screenshot
	above, the scroller has <i>minRows</i> set to 1, so the user cannot
	remove the first row. <i>maxRows</i> is set to 4, so in its current
	state the user can add one more row.
</p>
<p>
	An AttributeField represents an individual model attribute and may be
	represented as a column within a <i>RowScroller</i>.
</p>

<p>The Attribute which the AttributeField is bound to dictates the
	HTML form elements used to represent it, and the validations that will
	be applied to it. For example, a "choice" attribute is rendered as a
	drop down list; a "string" is rendered as a right justified text field.</p>

<p>Within a RowScroller, the RowScroller itself iterates over a
	collection of results rendering one row on the screen for each row of
	data in the collection. The columns in each row are represented by
	AttributeFields which are bound to <i>Attributes</i>
	in the quotation.</p>
<p>
	In the example above the RowScroller is bound to a collection of
	vehicle assets. The current quote contains two assets matching the
	criteria - an Alfa Romeo and a Bentley. The RowScroller contains nine
	AttributeFields each of which is bound to a different Attribute in the
	assets. The AttributeField bindings are taken to be relative to the
	binding of the RowScroller. In this case the RowScroller is bound to
	<code>asset[assetTypeId='Vehicle']</code>
	, and the individual AttributeFields are bound to
	<code>attribute[id='Make']</code>
	,
	<code>attribute[id='Model']</code>
	, etc
</p>
<p>
	Each AttributeField defines it's column <i>title</i>, and an optional <i>subTitle</i>
	which can be used when the titles are fixed. Dynamic titles - the text
	of which is picked up from another part of the quote - can be defined
	using a $&#123;xpath&#125; notation within the title or subtitle. It
	may also define javascript to be executed either onLoad (when the page
	is loaded); or onChange (when a fields value is changed).
</p>
<p>The AttributeField also supports the concept of RenderHints. The
	rendering engine will take these hints into account as it displays the
	field within the page. The values of hint supported are dependent on
	the Attribute being rendered. The supported hints are listed below:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><u>Attribute Type</u></td>
		<td><u>Render Hints</u></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>choice</td>
		<td>"dropdown" - Display the options on a drop down menu
			(default)<br />"radio" - Display the choice list as radio buttons
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>yesorno</td>
		<td>"dropdown" - Display the options on a drop down menu
			(default)<br />"checkbox" - Display as a checkbox<br />"radio" -
			Display Yes/No as radio buttons
	</tr>
