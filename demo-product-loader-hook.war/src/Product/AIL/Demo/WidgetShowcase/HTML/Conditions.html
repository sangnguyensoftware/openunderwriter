<p>Conditions are an essential element of PageFlow design. You might want to control
the content and questions displayed to a user based on an answer given on a previous 
page; you may want to fork the PageFlow down different routes based on the user's 
selections. You might also want to immediately prompt for additional details when the 
user answers a question in a specific way.</p>

<p>There are a number ways to achieve conditional content:

<ul>
	<li><p>
			<b>The QuestionWithDetails and QuestionWithSubSection widgets.</b>
			This is the most dynamic approach. The user is presented with the
			conditional content as soon as they have answered the question
			controlling it. Examples of these widgets can be found on the
			QuestionWithDetails and QuestionWithSubSection pages in the show
			case.
		</p></li>
	<li><p>
			<b>The 'condition' attribute.</b> This attribute is available to all
			widget types. It's value will be evaluated as an XPath expression
			then the page is rendered. If the result is true, then the related
			widget is included in the page; if it is false, it is not.
		</p></li>
	<li><p>
			<b>The "if" pageflow element.</b> This is very similar to the
			'condition' attribute above, but this widget has no side effect other
			than to evaluate the expression and render the content accordingly. A
			PageSection widget with a condition would have almost exactly the
			same effect from the user's perspective.
		</p></li>
</ul>
