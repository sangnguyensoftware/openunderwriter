<p>The BuyNowWithPayPalButtonAction provides the facility for
	PageFlows to authorise and collect premium payments using PayPal.</p>
<p>The button can be added to a navigation section as follows</p>
<pre>
     &lt;navigationSection&gt;
         &lt;buyNowWithPayPalButtonAction destinationOnSuccessPageId="<i>page id</i>" destinationOnFailurePageId="<i>page id</i>"/&gt;
         ...
     &lt;/navigationSection&gt;
</pre>
<p>
	This widget represents itself on the user interface as the familiar
	"Buy now with PayPal" button. When the user clicks the button
	OpenUnderwriter will create a PayPal payment request and then forward
	the user the PayPal login screen to authorise the payment. From here
	the user can either cancel the request or authorise it. If the request
	is cancelled, the user is returned to OpenUnderwriter at a point in the
	PageFlow specified by the
	<code>destinationOnFailurePageId</code>
	attribute.
</p>
<p>
	If the user authorises the payment, the payment is executed and the
	user is returned to OpenUnderwriter at a point in the PageFlow
	specified by the
	<code>destinationOnSuccessPageId</code>
	attribute. Executed payments are complete at will appear in the both
	the user's and merchant's transaction histories on PayPal.
</p>
<h4>Defining the amount to be paid</h4>
<p>The policy's paymentDetail object defines the amount to be paid.
	The payment services inspect the collection of MoneyProvisions held in
	policy.paymentDetails and create requests for each instance that they
	find which has a paymentMethod of PayPal and a status of NEW. Based on
	the following example, one payment request would be made for
	&pound;276.58.</p>
<pre>
     &lt;policy&gt;
         ...
         &lt;paymentDetails&gt;
             &lt;description&gt;Insurance premium payment&lt;/description&gt;
             &lt;moneyProvision&gt;
                 &lt;description&gt;Insurance premium payment&lt;/description&gt;
                 &lt;frequency&gt;ONE_TIME&lt;/frequency&gt;
                 &lt;number&gt;1&lt;/number&gt;
                 &lt;paymentsStartDate&gt;2014-05-21T16:23:28.705Z&lt;/paymentsStartDate&gt;
                 &lt;paymentsEndDate&gt;2014-05-21T16:23:28.705Z&lt;/paymentsEndDate&gt;
                 &lt;amount amount="276.58" currency="GBP"/&gt;
                 &lt;paymentMethod xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="payPal"/&gt;
                 &lt;status xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="java:java.lang.String"&gt;NEW&lt;/status&gt;
             &lt;/moneyProvision&gt;
         &lt;/paymentDetails&gt;
         ...
    &lt;/policy&gt;
</pre>
<p>In a typical PageFlow the paymentDetails object is created and
	populated using a JavaService once the quotation calculations have been
	completed.</p>
<p>Once a request has been sent to PayPal for a MoneyProvision, the instance's status
value is updated to REQUESTED.</p>
<h4>Configuring a product to accept payments</h4>
<p>In order for a product to accept PayPal payments it must first be
	configured with parameters defining the account into which payments
	will be made. These parameters are defined in the product's
	Registry.xml. The values may be defined in the root product of a
	hierarchy or set individually in the products themselves. This allows
	for each product to be configured with independent settings if
	necessary. The parameters involved are as follows:</p>
<pre>
&lt;configuration&gt;
    ...
    &lt;group name="PaymentMethods"&gt;
        &lt;group name="PayPal"&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="Mode"&gt;<i>mode</i>&lt;/parameter&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="ClientID"&gt;<i>Merchant's PayPal application client ID</i>&lt;/parameter&gt;
            &lt;parameter name="ClientSecret"&gt;<i>Merchant's PayPal application secret</i>&lt;/parameter&gt;
        &lt;/group&gt;
    &lt;/group&gt;
    ...
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre>
<ul>
	<li><i>mode</i> - Use "sandbox" while you are testing your product
		using mock-money, and "live" when you want to accept real payments.</li>
	<li><i>Merchant's PayPal application client ID</i> - The client ID
		generated by PayPal for the Merchant's application.</li>
	<li><i>Merchant's PayPal application secret</i> - The secret
		generated by PayPal for the Merchant's application.</li>
</ul>
<h4>PayPal sandbox login</h4>
<p>By default the page is setup to use OpenUnderwriter's PayPal sandbox. You can login to the sandbox using
the user: "client@openunderwriter.org" and the password "clientclient". Being a sanbox account, no actual 
financial transactions take place.</p>
