<p>Pages in PageFlow can one of two types: QuestionPage, as
	describer here, or InformationPage. An Information page is one that
	contains only readable information and navigation widgets. Whereas, a
	QuestionPage is one that support all of the form fields and invites
	user input.</p>
<pre>
    &lt;questionPage title="<i>title</i>" [stage="<i>stage</i>"] [showPageError="<i>showPageError</i>"]/&gt;
</pre>
<ul>
	<li><i>title</i> Title text to appear at the head of the page.</li>
	<li><i>stage</i> Name of the stage that this page is part of. This
		value is used to group pages into the progress bar. For example, if
		four pages all define their <i>stage</i> as "Payment" then the
		progress bar will include a single "Payment" stage and that stage will
		be shown as the current stage whenever one of those four pages is
		being viewed.</li>
	<li><i>showPageError</i> Can be 'true' or 'false'. If set to 'true' an
	    error banner will be displayed on the page when any errors are 
	    present. Defaults to 'true'.</li>
</ul>
<p>A progress bar will be included at the top of the page when two
	conditions are met:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The PageFlow&apos;s <i>progressBar</i> attribute is set to
		true.
	</li>
	<li>The page defines a stage attribute.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	This gives the PageFlow author the freedom to hide the progress bar on
	some pages (by leaving <i>state</i> undefined), or to disable it
	altogether by setting the PageFlow&apos;s <i>progressBar</i> attribute
	to false (which is the default setting).
