<p class="term-title"><b>Policy Cancellation</b><br />
</p>
<p class="term-body">You have the right to cancel your policy during
 a period of 14 days after the day of purchase of the contract or the day
 on which you receive your policy documentation, whichever is later. If
 you wish to do so and the insurance cover has not yet started, you will
 be entitled to a full refund of the premium paid.</p>
<p class="term-body">Alternatively, if you wish to do so and if the
 insurance cover has already started, you will be entitled to a refund of
 the premium paid, subject to a deduction for the time for which you have
 been covered calculated as a proportion of the time for which the
 insurance would have provided cover and an administration fee of &#163;30.45
 (including Insurance Premium Tax at the appropriate rate) to cover any
 costs incurred by us in issuing the policy. To exercise your right to
 cancel your policy, please call ${broker/quoteTelephoneNumber}. Please
 also return your certificate of motor insurance. If you do not exercise
 your right to cancel your policy, it will continue in force for the term
 of the policy and you will be required to pay the premium as stated.</p>

 of material information </b></p>
<p class="term-body">Failure to disclose all material information or
 any change in the information advised (i.e. information likely to
 influence the assessment of this risk) could invalidate the insurance.
 If you are in any doubt whether any information is material it should be
 disclosed. It is an offence under the Road Traffic Act to make any false
 statements or withhold any information to obtain a Certificate of Motor
 Insurance.</p>
<p class="term-body">Insurers pass information to the Claims and
 Underwriting Exchange Register, run by Insurance Database Services Ltd
 (IDS Ltd) and the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register, run by
 the Association of British Insurers (ABI). The aim is to help us to
 check information provided and also to prevent fraudulent claims. When
 we deal with your request for insurance, we may search these registers.
 Under the conditions of your policy, you must tell us about any incident
 (such as an accident or theft) which may or may not give rise to a
 claim. When you tell us about an incident, we will pass information
 relating to it to the registers. Your insurance cover details will be
 added to the Motor Insurance Database, run by the Motor Insurers'
 Information Centre (MIIC). This has been set up to help identify
 uninsured drivers, and may be searched by the Police to help confirm who
 is insured to drive. If there is an accident, the Database may be used
 by insurers, MIIC and the Motor Insurers' Bureau to identify relevant
 policy information. You can ask us for more information about this. You
 should show this notice to anyone insured to drive the vehicle covered
 under the policy.</p>
<p class="term-body">If I/we enter into an insurance contract on
 acceptance of this quotation I/we understand that you will pass the
 information on this form and about any incident I/we may give details of
 to IDS Ltd and ABI so that they can make it available to other insurers.
 I/we also understand that, in response to any searches you may make in
 connection with this application or any incident I/we have given details
 of, IDS Ltd and ABI may pass you information it has received from other
 insurers about other incidents anyone insured to drive the vehicle
 covered under the policy have been involved in.</p>
<p class="term-body">In assessing your application we may search the
 files of licensed credit reference agencies. They may keep a record of
 the search on their files. We may pass to licensed credit reference
 agencies details of your payment record with us. Credit agency data is
 used by businesses to assess applications for insurance, banking, loans,
 hire facilities and debt collection purposes.</p>
