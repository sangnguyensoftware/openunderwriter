<p>PageFlow supports the concept of limiting submit scope. By
	default when a page is submitted the whole page including all of its
	fields are submitted and passed through PageFlow&apos;s request cycle.
	This leads to all of the values on the page being applied to the
	underlying (persistent) model and all of the fields being subjected to
	validation.</p>
<p>Typically, where pages are small, this approach is desirable.
	However in some circumstances it is useful to be able to limit the scope of
	what submitted data to only include specific pageSections.</p>
<p>On this example page, the <code>outer</code> pageSection is submitted by the 
   "Save outer" commandButton. As <code>inner1</code> and <code>inner2</code> 
   are contained by <code>outer</code>, they are also submitted. "Save inner 1" 
   only submits <code>inner1</code>, and "Save inner 2" only submits <code>inner2</code></p>
