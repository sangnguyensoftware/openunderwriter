<p>A question widget that prompts for additional details if the user makes specific selections.</p>
<p>This widget handles the common situation where a form requires additional textual information 
	depending on the answer given to a question. In a motor quotation for example, the question 
	"Has the vehicle been modified in any way" could prompt for modification details.<p>
<p>This widget is shorthand version of QuestionWithSubSection. While that widget allows
	for any number and type of sub questions to be asked; this widget only prompts for additional
	text.</p>
<p>The default behaviour of QuestionWithDetails is to enable to detail field when the user 
	answers the base question with "Yes". However, this behaviour can be controlled by 
	specifying the "detailsEnabledFor" property. This defines a semicolon separated list of 
	values for which the details should be enabled.</p>
