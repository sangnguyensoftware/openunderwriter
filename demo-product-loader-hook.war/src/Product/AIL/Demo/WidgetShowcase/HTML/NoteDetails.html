<p>This widget that gives the user access the notes attached to an
	object and the ability to update/edit those notes. The widget can be
	configured to include/exclude notes from display based on their type
	and on the labels applied to them.</p>
<p>
	Notes may be applied to a number of object types: Policy, Claim,
	Document, PaymentHoliday, Party. The actual object can be selected
	using the <i>binding</i> attribute in the PageFlow. If no binding is
	specified then the current Policy object is assumed.
</p>
<p>The Notes widget also supports the notion that different object
	often have different note types. For example, a Policy may need to
	offer a "Cancellation note" type and a Claim a "Rejected note" note
	type. To support this a "typeDiscriminator" attribute can be used to
	select the Labels which define those note types. See the example
	Labels.xml in AIL.Base for examples.</p>

<u>Examples</u>
<p>Display all the notes on the current Policy.</p>
<pre>&lt;noteDetails /&gt;</pre>

<p>Display the notes on the current policy. Only include label types
	from the "cancellation_reason" group (see AIL.Base.Labels.xml) and
	further refine that list to exclude notes of type "watch" and
	"watch_reason". Also, hide any notes labelled as medically_sensitive.</p>
<pre>&lt;noteDetails typeDiscriminator="cancellation_reason" 
             validNoteTypes="(?!.*?(i18n_label_watch|i18n_label_note_watch_reason))^.*$" 
             validLabels="(?!.*?(i18n_label_medical_sensitive))^.*$"/&gt; </pre>

<hr />

<p>On this page the note details widget is configured to display
	policy notes excluding any note labelled as medically sensitive and to
	only include note types from the "cancellation_reason" group and then
	to exclude "watch" notes.</p>
